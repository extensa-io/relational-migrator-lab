# ðŸ“˜ Schema in PostgreSQL

The following screenshot shows an entity-relationship diagram of the relational database we wish to migrate. This is a library management app that stores information about books, where a book can have many authors, an author can write many books, and users can borrow books and leave reviews.

This is the sample schema we use during our [Developer Days's Intro Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/importing-data/intro).
