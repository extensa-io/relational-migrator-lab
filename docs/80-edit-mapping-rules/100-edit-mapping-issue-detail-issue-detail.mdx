# ðŸ¦¸ Remove unnecessary ids from issueDetails

:::info
Extra activity! Do it if you have extra time or are following along at home. It won't be covered during the hands-on lab.
:::

Now we want to remove some unncessary id fields from the issueDetails collection. We have `bookId` and `userId` but we also have these values in the embedded `book` and `user` fields.

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click the `issueDetails` collection.
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `issue_details` New Documents mapping rule.
- Uncheck the `bookId` and `userId` fields, and leave all other fields checked.
- Click `Save and close`.
