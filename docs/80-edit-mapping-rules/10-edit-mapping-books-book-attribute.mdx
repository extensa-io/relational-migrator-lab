# üëê Clean book attributes up  


We want to clean up the book_attributes array in our MongoDB schema. We want an array of objects containing attributes, modelled a key value pairs. something like:

```json
{
    "_id": 838383, // book id
    "attributes": [
        {
            "key": "price",
            "value": 11
        },
        {
            "key": "pages",
            "value": 236
        },
        // ...
    ] 
}
```

- On the MongoDB diagram view, click on the `books` collection.
- On the relational mappings list on the right, click on the edit icon of `book_attribute` embedded array mapping rule.
- Change the Field name from `bookAttributes` to `attributes`.
- Uncheck `bookId`. We just want all the attributes, which are key/value pairs. Also, as we're embedded inside books, we don't need the `bookId` anymore.
- Click `Save and close`.

Here we've implemented the [Attribute Pattern](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/attribute-pattern/) for MongoDB. This will allow for easy indexing, querying based on attributes and extension of attributes.
