Once the job has finished, you can view your data in MongoDB. You can perform this task using the `mongosh` command line tool,
MongoDB Compass, or MongoDB Atlas. This topic assumes you have migrated your data to MongoDB Atlas.

- In a web browser, navigate to the [MongoDB Atlas portal](https://cloud.mongodb.com) and sign in with your account
- Navigate to the cloud project containing the cluster you migrated data to
- Select your cluster and click `View collections`
- Select the database you migrated data to
- Select each of the collections and view the documents, confirming they conform to the schema you created.
