# üëê Setup

## GitHub Codespaces

You will be working in GitHub Codespaces throughout this lab. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab.

Navigate to [this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/rm-lab?quickstart=1) link. You will be prompted to sign into GitHub if you haven't already. Once signed in, click the **Create new codespace** button to create a new codespace.

Let it run for a few minutes as it prepares a Docker container with all the required libraries and a MongoDB cluster.

Your codespace will be ready when you see the MongoDB leaf on the VS Code extensions bar. Click it to connect to the MongoDB container.

Click on the `mongodb-container` connection and then on the `Create New Playground` button

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/codespaces" src="img/10-dev-env/3-create-playground.png" alt="Run playground" />

You need to create a database to migrate your exisiting PostgreSQL data into. Clear the playground area and copy and paste the following code in it:

```js
use('library-migrated');

// Add a new collection with a dummy document to ensure database creation.
db.test.insertOne({
  message: "Test collection created successfully for library-migrated database.",
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Create the user "lab" with readWrite access to the "library-migrated" database.
db.createUser({
  user: 'lab',
  pwd: 'mongodb',
  roles: [
    {
      role: 'readWrite',
      db: 'library-migrated',
    },
  ],
});
```

Now, click on the `Play` button to run the playground. You might have to approve the query execution by clicking `Yes` on the popup.

**That's it! You're ready for the lab!**

:::caution
 During the lab, we will use GitHub Codespaces. The following instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or if you really, really, really want a local installation.

  # 1. MongoDB Database

  As we'll be importing data from a Relational Database into MongoDB, you'll need to have a MongoDB database. You have a 
  few options to set up this database.

  ## ü¶∏ Option A: New MongoDB Atlas cluster

  The easiest way to run MongoDB is to use MongoDB Atlas, our cloud-hosted database offering.
  You can set a MongoDB Atlas account and a free forever M0 Cluster.

  To get yours, follow the instructions on the [Intro Lab:](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/what-is-mongodb)
  - [Create your Account](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-account)
  - [Deploy a Database Cluster](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/mongodb-atlas/create-cluster)

  Be sure to [open up the cluster to allow connections from your local computer](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/network-connections/#overview), and configure a database user with the readWriteAnyDatabase role. 


  ## ü¶∏ Option B: Use an existing cluster

  If you have an existing MongoDB Atlas, Enterprise or Community cluster, you can use it as the migration target. Make sure you
  know the URI for the cluster, and have a database user with the readWriteAnyDatabase role. 

  ## ü¶∏ Option C: Run a MongoDB container using Docker


  If you don't have an existing MongoDB server but have Docker installed, you can easily load a container pre-configured with 
  MongoDB by running the following command:

  ```
  docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo
  ```

  This will launch an empty MongoDB community cluster on localhost:27017, suitable to use for this lab. 
  You can connect with no username or password. Since this command does not use Docker volumes, any data will be lost when the container is stopped.


  # 2. MongoDB Relational Migrator

  Download and install MongoDB Relational Migrator. 

  - Go to the [MongoDB Relational Migrator downloads page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator), select your OS and download it
  - Install the MongoDB Relational Migrator 
  - Start it 
  - It should open a browser at the address http://127.0.0.1:8278/

  There are more advanced ways to install the MongoDB Relational Migrator. You can check them out in [the installation docs page](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/relational-migrator/installation/). These won't be covered during this Lab.
