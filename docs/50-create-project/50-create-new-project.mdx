## Select one of the three options
- Click **Connect to live database** if you are running the origin DB in the cloud, Docker or using your own hardware.
- Click **Load schema from a file** if you don't have access to a source database and just want to work with the schema (you won't have any data to import though).
- Click **Use a sample schema** to play around with a test schema, without any data. This does not require connecting to a real DB. We won't use this one in this Lab.
